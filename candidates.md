# How To Add Resumes / How To Add Candidates 

There are **two options** to upload candidates.

## 1. Upload Old Resumes or Upload Old Candidates

You may be migrating from your old recruiting software to CVViZ or it may be the first time you are using an applicant tracking system like CVViZ. There is a possibility that you may have tons of resumes sitting on your machine or in your emails. Naturally, you do not want to upload these resumes against any new job as these are old resumes. In that case, you can go to the tab Candidate Database and upload your resumes there. 

**Candidate Database --> Add Candidates**

**You should use tags as much as possible. Tags will help you in searching or ranking candidates.**
